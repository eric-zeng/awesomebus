# AwesomeBus: Seattle Mass Transit Visualization
Lucy Simko and Eric Zeng

AwesomeBus is a d3-based visualization of the bus, light rail, streetcar, and
ferry routes in the Seattle metro area. We use King County Metro's public GTFS
feed to display these routes.

## How to view the visualization locally
If you want to view the visualization on a local copy of the repository, your
need to run a local web server since d3 needs to make XHRs to retrieve data.

1. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888`
2. Open `localhost:8888` in the browser.


## How to generate the data
`data/routePathData.json` contains processed data for the visualization. It was
generated by querying the GTFS data and exporting to JSON. This is how to
reproduce those steps:

Before starting, install PostgreSQL, and make sure the psql service is running.

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:CSE512-16S/a3-lucysimko-eric-zeng.git
```

2. Create the database. This adds the data from `data/.*_noheader.txt` into your
Postgres instance.
```
cd data
./createDatabase.sh
```
3. Extract the route data to JSON. This runs a query and then converts it to
JSON.
```
./routePathExporter.py
```
